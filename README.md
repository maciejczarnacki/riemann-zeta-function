## Riemann zeta function non-trivial zeros vizualization

Code generating values ​​of the Riemann zeta function.

I like python and sympy. Take a look at the animation I prepared below. If someone has an idea, there is a million dollars to win. The animation shows the Riemann zeta function. Notice the red line, which at the moment when the function arguments take the values ​​s = 1/2 + i*t the red line touches the line 0 at some points. These are non-trivial zeros of the zeta function. If someone knows if there are such zeros for the real part of the argument other than 1/2 or that all zeros occur only for 1/2 and can explain it, they have a million in their pocket. This is one of the yet unproven Millennium Prize Problems.
